# Bike Rental Demand Prediction Model for Chicago

## Project Overview
This project showcases my data analytics and machine learning expertise, where I developed a model to predict daily bike rental demand for Chicago. Competing against 67 participants in the **Computational Data Analytics (DD Spring 2024)** Kaggle competition, my solution ranked **2nd on the leaderboard**, achieving a **score of 0.83380**.

The analysis involved:
- Identifying factors influencing bike rental demand.
- Building multiple regression models, fine-tuning hyperparameters, and comparing their performance.
- Selecting the best-performing model for making predictions on unseen data.

This project demonstrates practical applications of predictive modeling, feature engineering, and hyperparameter tuning, highlighting my ability to deliver high-performing models under competitive conditions.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation
- **Pandas, NumPy**: Data manipulation and processing
- **Scikit-Learn**: Machine learning models, hyperparameter tuning
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn**: Data visualization
- **Kaggle**: Competitions and model evaluation

## Repository Structure
- `Data/`: Contains the training data file (`chicago_training_data.xlsx`) and final predictions file (`final_model_predictions.csv`) submitted to Kaggle.
- `Code/`: Jupyter Notebook with the full analysis, model training, and evaluation (`Compagnone_Stefano_A1.ipynb`).
- `Output/`: Kaggle submission predictions file for the final model (`final_model_predictions.csv`).
- `Docs/`: Supporting documents, including competition leaderboard screenshot for reference.

## Key Insights
- My solution leveraged regression modeling techniques to identify key factors influencing bike rental demand, such as weather conditions, day of the week, and seasonal trends.
- The model achieved high accuracy on both training and testing datasets while maintaining minimal overfitting.
- Ranking **2nd place out of 67 participants on Kaggle** demonstrates the effectiveness of the model and my ability to deliver competitive solutions in a real-world context.
