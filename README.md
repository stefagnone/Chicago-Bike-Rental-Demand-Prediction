# Chicago Bike Rental Demand Prediction

## Project Overview
In this project, I developed a machine learning model to predict daily bike rental demand in the Chicago metropolitan area. Working with the Cook County Planning and Development Department, the goal was to provide insights into factors influencing bike rental demand and build a reliable predictive model. This project leverages regression techniques to address the increasing need for bike rental services due to convenience, sustainability, and fitness trends.

The analysis focused on:
- Identifying key variables that impact daily bike rental demand.
- Evaluating multiple regression models to find the best predictive solution.
- Conducting hyperparameter tuning on top-performing models for improved accuracy.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Data analysis and machine learning modeling
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive code development
- **Scikit-Learn**: Model building, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib and Seaborn for exploratory data visualization

## Repository Structure
- `Data/`: Contains the dataset file (`chicago_training_data.xlsx`) used for training the models.
- `Code/`: Includes the Jupyter Notebook (`Compagnone_Stefano_A1.ipynb`) with the full analysis, model development, and final predictions.
- `Submissions/`: Contains the Kaggle submission file (`final_predictions.csv`) with the final model's predictions.

## Key Insights
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) revealed significant features impacting bike rental demand, including weather conditions, time of year, and economic factors.
- Feature engineering created additional meaningful features that enhanced model interpretability.
- Ridge Regression emerged as the top-performing model after hyperparameter tuning, providing accurate predictions with minimal overfitting.

## Instructions
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook (`Compagnone_Stefano_A1.ipynb`) in Jupyter or JupyterLab.
3. Ensure the required libraries are installed as per the imports in the notebook.
4. Review the generated predictions in `final_predictions.csv` and insights from the EDA and model analysis.
