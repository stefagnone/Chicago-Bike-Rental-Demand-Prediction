# Bike Rental Demand Prediction Model for Chicago

## Project Overview
In this project, I developed a machine learning model to predict daily bike rental demand for Chicago, leveraging a dataset provided by the Cook County Planning and Development Department. This model will help city planners understand demand trends and make data-driven decisions to optimize bike-sharing services.

The analysis focused on:
- Identifying factors that influence bike rental demand.
- Building multiple regression models, tuning hyperparameters, and comparing model performance.
- Selecting a final model and making predictions based on the modelâ€™s accuracy.

The project demonstrates practical application in predictive modeling, feature engineering, and data-driven decision-making.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation
- **Pandas, NumPy**: Data manipulation and processing
- **Scikit-Learn**: Machine learning models, hyperparameter tuning
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn**: Data visualization

## Repository Structure
- `Data/`: Contains the training data file (`chicago_training_data.xlsx`) and final predictions file (`final_model_predictions.csv`) submitted on Kaggle.
- `Code/`: Jupyter Notebook with the full analysis, model training, and evaluation (`Compagnone_Stefano_A1.ipynb`).
- `Output/`: Kaggle submission predictions file for the final model (`final_model_predictions.csv`).

## Key Insights
- The model identified significant predictors for bike rental demand, such as weather conditions, day of the week, and seasonal patterns.
- Among various models, the best-performing model achieved a high accuracy on both training and testing datasets, minimizing overfitting.
- Insights from the analysis will aid in improving bike-sharing infrastructure and addressing peak demand periods effectively.

## Instructions
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`Compagnone_Stefano_A1.ipynb`) in Jupyter or any compatible environment.
3. Ensure that required libraries (like `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`) are installed.
4. Run the notebook to explore data analysis, model training, and final predictions.
5. Review the predictions in `Output/final_model_predictions.csv`.
